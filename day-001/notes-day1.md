# Day 1 – Why I'm Learning Spring + React

- I keep seeing Spring and React in Java job listings.
- I want to build apps that can turn into a business.
- I like the idea of shipping small tools, not giant systems.

## What micro-SaaS means to me

- Mini service applications that can be monetized.
- Small, focused tools that solve one problem well.
- Something I can run quietly on the side.

## My coding commitment

- Code at least on weekdays (5x per week).
- Focus on tiny but consistent progress.
